# R Chi-Square Post Hoc over the Fisher Exact Test

This function separates the lager than 2x2 tables to 2x2 tables for each of combination of rows and columns. Then, implements Fisher's exact test for each 2x2 table. This provides to determine the dependency of each independent double-categories according to each double-categories of the dependent variable. It can be implement for explore specific binary relations after implement chi-square test.
